= Digest =
Send out a digest to your users

Original plugin by ColdTrick.
This version does not require the html_email_handler plugin. It uses elgg's email event handler.
The phpmailer plugin is recommended, as it allows for HTML mails to be sent. Elgg's default email functions do not send HTML mail.
